    You cannot adjust the column width by dragging the column menu.

  `PlutoGridStateManager.setShowColumnTitle`

  In the link above, you can hide or show the entire column area by clicking the toggle column title button in the top show menu.

  (`PlutoGridStateManager.dragTargetColumnColor`)
* Modified to pass `PlutoColumn` instead of passing `PlutoColumn.key` when calling `hideColumn`.
* Add `PlutoGridStateManager.hideColumns(List<PlutoColumn> columns, bool hide)`
* Changes due to the constraint of a frozen column.
  - The width of the frozen column cannot be expanded beyond the limit width.
  - When changing a non-frozen column to a frozen column, it cannot be changed if the constraint width is insufficient.
  - If a column with a hidden frozen column state is unhidden in a narrow constraint width, the column frozen state is forcibly changed to `PlutoColumnFrozen.none`.
  - If the entire grid width is narrowed to less than the constraint width while   
    there is a frozen column, the frozen column is permanently changed to `PlutoColumnFrozen.none`, and it does not return to the frozen column again even if the grid width is increased.
* Change the logic to move by dragging rows.  
  Previous behavior: rows are moved while dragging.  
  Changed behavior: It does not move while dragging, but moves only when you mouse-up or tap-up.
* Changed logic for scrolling when dragging rows, column or selecting rows or cells.  
  `Previous version`: Scrolling continues only when the pointer is moved continuously so that the move event of the mouse (tab) continues to occur  
  `Changed version`: If the move event of the mouse (tab) occurs only once, the scroll event continues in the scroll direction. The scroll animation continues to the end of the scroll direction even if the move event is not triggered by continuously moving the pointer.  
  The scroll animation stops when the pointer enters a grid that does not require scrolling or when a MouseUp(PointerUp) event is fired.
* Expand Columns to cover the parent Container Width.
* Support RTL.  
  Changed left and right of `PlutoColumn.frozen` to start and end.

  https://weblaze.dev/pluto_grid/build/web/#feature/rtl
